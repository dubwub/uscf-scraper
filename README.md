# uscf-scraper
little project to web scrape my uscf stats for visualization use

written in python 2.7

## usage
replace my ID in my code: 13034164 with whatever your playerID is (look at the URL), then change the pageRange as needed (mine only goes up to 174 tournaments so my page range is 1 -> 4), then run the script!

testfile is sample output
